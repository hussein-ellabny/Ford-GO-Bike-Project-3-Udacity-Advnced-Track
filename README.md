Advanced track Udacity Project 3

Dataset
There are 174,898 trips recorded with complete data in the dataset , these data divided to four dimensions ( trip time , start and end location , bike data and user data ). The data differ between numeric and categorical .

Summary of Findings
In the exploration, I found that The targeted customers characteristics : 1- Gender : Male . 2- Type : Subscriber . 3- Age : 20 to 40 . 4- Most common trip hour from 1 to 2 hours . we checked and find these conclusion throw our journey thus we could get use of these by : For low density customers stations we can use these targeted customers in marketing and offers which will increase the revenue of the company. For high density customers stations if there still work capicity available we can increase revenues by 2 ways : 1- Offers for females between 20 to 40 years even for subscriber or customer type. 2- More engagement for targeted customer with above characteristics .

Key Insights for Presentation
For the presentation, I focus on the main Variable that will help me is the locations that has the most density and then , I investigated the relation between them and the other variables . So That , in cleaning I choosed in new dataset with the data that include the most 15 start and end stations that have density.

I started by looking at the main variable of interest: The locations figures, Then the most 15 start & end stations that have high customers density .

Afterwards, Customers characteristics (type , gender , Age ) , Then dig deep in the common customers characteristics and trip duration for each station even start or end to check if there is any variance and there was no variance.

At the end whe use multivariate plots they confirmed what found from the begining for targeted customers characteristics.
